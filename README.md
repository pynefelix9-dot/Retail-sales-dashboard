## RETAIL_SALES_DASHBOARD
Interactive retail sales performance dashboard built in Excel 

This project presents a comprehensive Sales Dashboard built to analyze sales performance across customer and product dimensions, including gender, product, location, size, and age group.

The dashboard highlights key performance trends, showing how sales vary across demographics and product categories, and provides clear comparisons of size performance and regional distribution.

## Data Preparation and Transformation

During preparation:

* Pivot Tables were created to aggregate sales by gender, product, location, size, and age group.
* Pivot Charts were used to visualize these summaries.
* An Age Group column was created because it did not originally exist in the dataset. Customers were grouped into defined age ranges for better analysis.
* A Customer Behavior column was added to classify customers as New, Returning, or Loyal, since this was not included in the raw data.

These transformations improved the structure of the dataset and enabled deeper analysis.

## Dashboard Insights

The dashboard shows:

* Sales distribution by gender
* Top-performing products
* Regional sales performance
* Size comparison and purchasing patterns
* Revenue contribution by age group
* Customer behavior trends (New vs Returning vs Loyal)

Overall, the dashboard transforms raw sales data into clear, structured insights that support better business decision-making.
